# Portfolio Management 
In Portfolio 1 file, the goal is to compare computational investment strategies based on four strategies
1. Buy And Hold 2. Equally-weighted 3. Minimum Variance 4. Maximum Sharpe Ratio 

Procedures and Rules:
1. Given a initial stock portfolio (value is equal to 1 million)
2. Every two months will re-balance the portfolio according to respective strategies (main input is the mean and variance)
3. Taking the transaction cost into considerations
4. Shall ensure the cash account have positive number all the time (except leverage method if any)
5. Only integer number of stock and be sold or bought
6. No Short sell allow

In Portfolio 2 file, everything is the same except three more strategies are introduced 
1. Equal Risk Contribution 2. Leverage Equal Risk Contribution 3. Robust Mean Variance Optimization 

Seven strategies are test in both bull (2020-2021) and bear market (2008-2009)
